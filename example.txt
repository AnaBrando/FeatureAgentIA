Subject: Application – Senior Backend Engineer | .NET + AWS

Hi [Recruiter’s Name],

I came across your post on LinkedIn and was immediately interested in the [Job Title] role.

With over 6 years of experience in backend development (C#/.NET), building scalable APIs and cloud-native applications with AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, Terraform), I believe I could contribute meaningfully to your team.

I’ve worked with companies in the US, Europe, and Brazil, including financial and investment domains — always focused on delivering clean, maintainable, and business-driven solutions.

I’ve attached my resume for your review and would love the opportunity to discuss how I could be a good fit for your current needs.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Ana Paula Chaves
